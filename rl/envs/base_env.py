    Example of a simple rollout loop:
    .. code-block:: python
        env = MyEnv()
        policy = MyPolicy()
        first_observation, episode_info = env.reset()
        env.visualize()  # visualization window opened
        episode = []
        # Determine the first action
        first_action = policy.get_action(first_observation, episode_info)
        episode.append(env.step(first_action))
        while not episode[-1].last():
           action = policy.get_action(episode[-1].observation)
           episode.append(env.step(action))
        env.close()  # visualization window closed

    Make sure your environment is pickle-able:
        Garage pickles the environment via the `cloudpickle` module
        to save snapshots of the experiment. However, some environments may
        contain attributes that are not pickle-able (e.g. a client-server
        connection). In such cases, override `__setstate__()` and
        `__getstate__()` to add your custom pickle logic.
        You might want to refer to the EzPickle module:
        https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/utils/ezpickle.py
        for a lightweight way of pickle and unpickle via constructor
        arguments.

      of type TERMINAL or TIMEOUT) at the previous step, this call to
      `step()` will start a new sequence and `action` will be ignored.

      If `spec.max_episode_length` is reached after applying the action
      and the environment has not terminated the episode, `step()` should
      return a `EnvStep` with `step_type==StepType.TIMEOUT`.

      If possible, update the visualization display as well.

      Args:

        EnvStep: The environment step resulting from the action.
